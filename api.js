Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Wrap with plastic wrap and store overnight at room temperature to give the cake a chance to firm up before slicing. To make the icing: In a large bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and cocoa.

        {"category":"dessert","name":"Giant Fruit Danish","description":"Simple, delicious, and pairs perfectly with coffee or tea!","ingredients":"1/2 tsp Lemon,1 large egg,1/4 cup Raspberry jam,2 tsp Granulated sugar,1/4 tsp Kosher salt,15 tbsp Powdered sugar,1 Vegetable oil,1 sheet Puff pastry,6 oz Cream cheese,2 tsp Milk","preparation":"Preheat the oven to 400F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.To make the cream cheese filling, mix together the softened cream cheese, sugar, extracts, and lemon juice until smooth. Start off with a fork to loosen up the mixture then switch to a whisk to remove any lumps. Set aside.In a separate bowl, mix together the Bonne Maman INTENSE Red Fruits Fruit Spread, berries, and cornstarch. Set aside.Unfold the thawed puff pastry and lay it flat onto a floured surface or sheet of parchment paper. Roll it out just until the seams are blended, rolling a couple times both length and width-wise.Slice the puff pastry in half right down the middle lengthwise using a pizza cutter. Slice each half into 3 rectangles width-wise, along the blended seams, to make 6 Danish. Transfer the sheets onto a baking tray and make sure they’re evenly spaced apart. Use a knife to score a 1/4 inch border around the outside. This allows the edges to rise in order to contain the filling. Don’t cut all the way through, but just enough to leave behind a clear border.Lightly brush the edges with an egg wash. Whisk together the egg with 2 teaspoons of milk or water and use a pastry brush to apply. This helps the edges turn golden brown and glossy once baked.Scoop 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into the center of each Danish. The filling makes the exact amount for 6 Danish, so use it all up. Spread the filling within the border using the back of a spoon.Dollop the fruit filling into the center of the cream cheese. Don’t overcrowd the cream cheese layer, as you should be able to see the cream cheese peeking out from under the fruit (see post for reference photo).Bake the Danish on the middle rack of the oven for 20-25 minutes, until evenly puffed with golden brown edges.When they’re still warm on the baking sheet, brush the tops with a little extra fruit spread. This adds a glossy shine and extra fruity flavor.Transfer the Danish to a cooling rack. They’re best served fresh and warm. See notes in the blog post about prepping the Danish ahead so they’re ready to bake in the morning.As an optional topping, whisk together the powdered sugar and liquid of choice until it reaches a thin glue-like consistency. If it’s too thick, add a touch more liquid. Too thin, add a bit more sugar. Drizzle on top of the warm Danish and enjoy!","image1":"https://www.rockrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DSC3343-e1458916544317.jpg","image2":"https://images-gmi-pmc.edge-generalmills.com/be2b2976-4239-49c8-b84d-a87c20151791.jpg","image3":"https://fotovisualista.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/@CMCA-73-w.jpg"}
